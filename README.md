# Montessory Toy Recommender

For my data science bootcamp graduation project I chose to build a Montessory toy recommender. On a webpage, the user needs to select the age group of their child and the skills the toy should help develope. Once this information is provided a page will load with 5 recommendations. The name of the toy, image, price and Amazon link are shown on the recommendations page.
